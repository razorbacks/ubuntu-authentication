# Shibboleth Single Sign On for Apache 2.4

Before you begin, make sure you have a valid SSL certificate installed
on the web server. You can [create a certificate signing request][7] and then
[create an AskIT ticket][6] pasting in the CSR to get one.

`shibd` needs to download the IdP (Identity Provider) metadata in order to start up correctly,
so make sure there is no firewall blocking traffic from your server to
https://federation.uark.edu otherwise you will need to [request a policy][9]
for TCP port 443.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install the [service provider][1] and [Apache web server module][2].

    sudo apt install shibboleth-sp2-schemas libapache2-mod-shib2

[Download the script `keygen.sh`][8] and make it executable.

    chmod +x keygen.sh

Run the script with `sudo` to make the certificate/key pair for `_shibd` user.

    sudo ./keygen.sh -o /etc/shibboleth -u _shibd -g _shibd

Open https://itsforms.uark.edu/shib2xml and under `Entity id` type
`https://{YOUR HOSTNAME}/shibboleth` and click <kbd>Generate</kbd>

Replace `/etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml` with generated file.

**Note** that by default, shib will use the TEST IdP (acmex.uark.edu).

[Uncomment][10] the "Examples of LDAP-based attributes" in `/etc/shibboleth/attribute-map.xml`
on roughly lines 88 to 142 by deleting the enclosing lines that contain `<!--` and `-->` around
the `Attribute` tags, such as:

```xml
<Attribute name="urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:cn" id="cn"/>
```

Create a folder in your web server directory root called `secure`
Inside you can create an `.htaccess` file with these contents:

    AuthType shibboleth
    ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1
    Require valid-user

**Note** you must have enabled [`AllowOverride AuthConfig` or `AllowOverride All`][3]
in the primary virtual host configuration file. Alternatively, you can create a
[`Directory`][4] or a [`Location`][5] tag in the configuration file with the
same contents.

Start/restart the services.

    sudo service shibd restart
    sudo service apache2 restart

In browser, verify `https://{YOUR HOSTNAME}/secure` redirects to `acmex.uark.edu`
(you will receive an error page at this point).

Download the Metadata from `https://{YOUR HOSTNAME}/Shibboleth.sso/Metadata`

[Create an AskIT ticket][6] requesting your site Metadata be added to the IdP
server. Attach the downloaded Metadata to the ticket.

Once entered into IdP servers, the change takes about 15 minutes to propagate.

Edit `/etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml` to use the production IdP server instead
of the test server by changing line 46 from:

```xml
<SSO entityID="https://acmex.uark.edu/idp/shibboleth">
```

to:

```xml
<SSO entityID="https://idp.uark.edu/idp/shibboleth">
```

Restart the services.

    sudo service shibd restart
    sudo service apache2 restart

Visit `https://{YOUR HOSTNAME}/secure` again, and you should get the login page.

## Additional Virtual Hosts

For each domain name, youâ€™ll need to set up an `ApplicationOverride` in
`/etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml` ***at the end*** of the `ApplicationDefaults` tag.
It requires an application `id` unique to your server, and an `entityId` unique
to the IdP. By convention, this is the virtual host name with `/shibboleth`
appended to the end. For example:

```xml
<ApplicationOverride id="example" entityID="https://example.uark.edu/shibboleth"/>
```

Again you must generate the Metadata for each virtual host by visiting
`https://{YOUR*OTHER*HOSTNAME}/Shibboleth.sso/Metadata` and then submitting that
in an [AskIT ticket][6] to be added to the IdP server.

Then you must declare the override `applicationID` in the document root of the
virtual host.

This must be in a [`<Directory /path/to/site/root>`][4] or a [`<Location />`][5]
tag or in an `.htaccess` in the root folder of the site.

    ShibRequestSetting applicationID example

Restart the services.

    sudo service shibd restart
    sudo service apache2 restart

## Active Directory Groups

Aside from `require valid-user` the real power lies in leveraging active directory
security groups for access control. In shibboleth, these are referred to as "entitlements"
and you can take a look at them by reading what's been populated into the php `$_SERVER`
variable after login.

```php
<?php print_r($_SERVER);
```

For example, if you wanted to limit access to a location for just the members of `WCOB-JazzUsers`
then your `.htaccess` require directive would look like this:

    AuthType shibboleth
    ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1
    Require shib-attr entitlement "urn:mace:uark.edu:ADGroups:Walton College:Security Groups:WCOB-JazzUsers"

## Logging Out

To logout of the IdP server, the URL is https://idp.uark.edu/idp/exit.jsp

So to logout of your server, the url would be:

    https://{YOUR HOSTNAME}/Shibboleth.sso/Logout?return=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.uark.edu%2Fidp%2Fexit.jsp

Return parameter being url encoded. This will destroy their session on the SP,
then send them to the IdP and destroy their session there. They may, however,
still have active sessions on other SPs that will not be destroyed.

## Lazy Loading

Sometimes you want locations available to the public with an optional login.
In other words, you display the same page to everyone, but those who are logged in might see additional
content, such as their username displayed in the navigation menu.
This is called lazy shib. In the root of your site, you will need to `requireSession false` and `require shibboleth`

```xml
<Location />
 AuthType Shibboleth
 ShibRequestSetting requireSession false
 Require shibboleth
</Location>
```

You may still secure other locations normally by requiring the session and any other constraints,
such as a specific user or entitlement.

```xml
<Location /secure>
 AuthType Shibboleth
 ShibRequestSetting requireSession true
 Require valid-user
</Location>
```

## Notes on URL Rewriting

If you're using an application router to handle requests, as in Wordpress, Laravel, etc.
then you'll probably have some rewrite rules to send all non-existent files to your router page. e.g.

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
 
In some strange cases, you may find that this rewrite rule interferes with Shibboleth's locations.
A fix would be to add the condition to not rewrite paths to Shibboleth.

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/Shibboleth [NC]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
